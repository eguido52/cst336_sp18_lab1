                    We’d like to be writers, but as everybody knows<br />
                    —we can’t earn any money that way. What do you want to do?<br /> 
                    When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do,<br /> 
                    I will say to him you do that—and uhm—forget the money.<br />
                    If you say that getting the money is the most important thing,<br /> 
                    you will spend your life completely wasting your time..."
